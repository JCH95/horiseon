  Repo for Challenge 1 of the coding bootcamp.

## HTML Changes
  Changed the header and footer divs to read out the respective semantic arguments (<header> and <footer>).
  Changed a div to 'aside' and added 'section' semantics into the parts of the aside.
  Changed a div to 'article' and added 'section' semantics.
  Added notes to each HTML semantic section for identifying said sections easier.

## CSS Changes
  Condensed any and all commands that shared the same code (benefit-lead, brand, and cost, search-engine-optimization, etc.).
  Changed the divs that had classes to match the new semantic arguments (header, footer, etc.).
  Added notes to identify/match each portion of the code to the HTML document, along with brief descriptions of what each section does.
